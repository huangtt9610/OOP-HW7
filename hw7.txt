Q1.
	There is no specific explanation to this particular question online. By collecting the information 
from web, my guess is that when you throw an exception, the throwable in the catch block knows what type of 
exception it is handling. Therefore, we don't need to handle the new throwable throwed in the catch block 
because the compiler knows it will only be handling the unchecked exception. The websitebelow prove my point 
that JVM knows what exception is catched by Throwable.

Q2.

	super.method and interface.super.method have similar syntax. There is only one superclass you can extend 
for each subclass. So using super.method, the JVM knows you are calling the method of superclass. However, for the 
interface, you can implements as many as you want. To clarify which default method of the interfaces you are using, 
you need to put the interfacename before calling the super method.
